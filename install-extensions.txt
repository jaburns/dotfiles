This method works by accessing and downloading the .crx file directly.

We do this by using a template URL that takes us right to the .crx file. The template URL is:

https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx?response=redirect&acceptformat=crx2,crx3&prodversion=[VERSION]&x=id%3D[EXTENSION_ID]%26installsource%3Dondemand%26uc

Note the VERSION and EXTENSION_ID in brackets in the URL...

VERSION = the Chromium browser version
EXTENSION_ID = is the unique ID of the extension. This comes from an extension's Chrome Web Store page URL.
Let's run through an example. This time, I will be installing the LocalCDN extension.

1. Get Chromium browser version
We need to get the version of Chromium we have installed on our system. This is pretty simple.

Open your Chromium browser
Access the browser's menu. It should be in the top right.
Click About Chromium
A new tab should open. This tab should have the version number right there for you, like so:
about chromium version settings

Copy this version number exactly as you see it, periods and all. Be sure not to copy and extra spaces before or after the number.
Paste this version number somewhere safe and easily accessed because we will be using it later. For example, I'm pasting mine into Notepad. No need to save.
2. Get the extension ID
Now, we need to get the extension ID from the Chrome Web Store.

Open any browser of choice. It doesn't have to be a Chromium based browser.
Go to the Chrome Web Store.
Search for the extension you want to download.
Go to the extension's Chrome Web Store page. Again, I'm on the page for LocalCDN:
localcdn chrome web store page

Simply look at your browser's address bar. The extension ID is the series of seemingly random letters at the end of the URL:
extension id of localcdn

As you can see, LocalCDN's extension ID is njdfdhgcmkocbgbhcioffdbicglldapd

Copy this extension ID. Be sure not to accidentally copy any extra spaces after the ID.
Paste this ID somewhere safe. We'll need it later.
3. Installing via the CRX URL
We have both the Chromium browser version number and the ID number of the extension we are installing.

Now it's time to actually pull the .crx file by using the template URL found earlier in this guide.

Paste the Chromium browser version number in place of VERSION. Keep the periods, delete any extra spaces you may have accidentally copied. Be sure to delete the brackets as well!
Paste the extension ID in place of EXTENSION_ID. Delete any accidental spaces and the brackets as well!
Your final URL should look something like this:
https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx?response=redirect&acceptformat=crx2,crx3&prodversion=86.0.4240.183&x=id%3Dnjdfdhgcmkocbgbhcioffdbicglldapd%26installsource%3Dondemand%26uc

Press Enter on your keyboard.
In a couple of seconds, you should get a dialog box, like so:
install localcdn crx

Click Add extension. Your extension should install.
